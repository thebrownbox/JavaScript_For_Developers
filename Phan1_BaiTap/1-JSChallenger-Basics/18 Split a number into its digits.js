//? Write a function that takes a number (a) as argument
//? Split a into its individual digits and return them in an array
//? Tipp: you might want to change the type of the number for the splitting

function myFunction(a = 0) {}

console.log(myFunction(10)); //* [1,0]
console.log(myFunction(931)); //* [9,3,1]
console.log(myFunction(193278)); //* [1,9,3,2,7,8]
