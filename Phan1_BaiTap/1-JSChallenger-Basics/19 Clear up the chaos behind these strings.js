//? It seems like something happened to these strings
//? Can you figure out how to clear up the chaos?
//? Write a function that joins these strings together such that they form the following words:
//? 'Javascript', 'Countryside', and 'Downtown'
//? You might want to apply basic JS string methods such as replace(), split(), slice() etc

function myFunction(a = "", b = "") {}

console.log(myFunction("java", "tpi%rcs")); //* 'Javascript'
console.log(myFunction("c%ountry", "edis")); //* 'Countryside'
console.log(myFunction("down", "nw%ot")); //* 'Downtown'
